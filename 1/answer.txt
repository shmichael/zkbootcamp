1.
    a. 1
    b. 1
    c. Ill-defined because there is an additive and a multiplicative inverse. Additive inverse is 4 and multiplicative is 5.
2. Yes
    Associative: (a+b) mod p = (b+a) mod p, because a+b = b+a (integer addition)
    Identity element: 0
    Inverse element: For any a, 7-a is the inverse. a + 7 - a = 7 â‰¡ 0 (mod p).
3. 2 (-13 + 15)
4.
    Root: 2 (just tried a few values)
    Degree: 3
